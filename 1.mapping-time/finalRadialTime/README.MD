### Radial Time

Inspired a the solar system diagram, my final [Right Twice a Day](https://dvia.samizdat.co/2019/right-twice-a-day/) assignment uses shape and rotation to animate the current time of the day, week and month. Following the goal of the assignment, the final outcome (and previous sketches) were made using P5.js as a way to map primitive shapes onto the time of day. 

Starting from the centre out, the purple circle (not on a grey ring) represents the hour. Over the course of the day, it changes in size and vibrancy to reflect the different hours. The concentric circles rotate on the rings. The dark pink is the minutes, while the bright pink is the seconds. 

The two outer rings with blue circles represent the calendar variables. The dark blue circle is the day and the light blue circle is the week. When both circles complete a full rotation, they represent the week and month. In order to distinguish the long term variables, there is a change in the size, colour of the circles and a darker grey stroke on the rings. 

Connecting to Jacques Bertin's design theory <i>Retinal Variables,</i> this project highlights the use of colour, size, shape and orientation.
