The following sketches are my three concepts for the [Mapping Time](https://dvia.samizdat.co/2019/right-twice-a-day/) assignment. 

1. The first idea is inspired by solar system diagrams. The center circle represents the hour while the concentric cirlces represent minutes and seconds. This sketch highlights three types of Bertins retinal variables; size, colour and shape.

2. The second sketch is similar to the bar chart in the examples as it uses three bars of the same size to represent hour, minute and second. My idea is to have clear markers in each bar to visually communicate which hour/minute/second of the time it is. Using colour to distingish the variables these bars act a vertical meter of time. The retinal variables used in this example are colour and shape. 

3. The final example highlights three shapes (from large to small) to represent the heiarchy of time. Using colour meters in each shape the progression of time is highlighted. This example uses the retinal variables of colour, size and shape.
