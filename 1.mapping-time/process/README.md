## Clock Sketches

The following sketches are my three concepts for the [Mapping Time](https://dvia.samizdat.co/2019/right-twice-a-day/) assignment.

1. The first idea is inspired by solar system diagrams. The centre circle represents the hour while the concentric circles represent minutes and seconds. This sketch highlights three types of Bertin’s retinal variables; size, colour and shape. 

2. The second sketch is similar to the bar chart in the examples as it uses three bars of the same size to represent hour, minute and second. My idea is to have clear markers in each bar to visually communicate which hour/minute/second of the time it is. Using colour to distinguish the variables these bars act a vertical meter of time. The retinal variables used in this example are colour and shape.

3. The final example highlights three shapes (from large to small) to represent the hiearchy of time. Using colour meters in each shape the progression of time is highlighted. This example uses the retinal variables of colour, size and shape.

## Clock Final Outcome
Below are screenshots of my final clock P5 sketches. I tried to stay as close to my hand drawn sketches, particularly in my first two sketches. The third iteration uses rectlangles instead of circles to represent the colour meters.

## Calendar Sketches

The following sketches are my three concepts for the extension of the mapping time assignment. Each sketches explores time two of the longer-term calendar variables

1. The first sketch was inspired by [Time are A-Changing](https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2018/02/27/times-are-a-changing/) piece in the Cooper Hewitt Collection. I liked the idea of fan-ing out each element of a calendar. The inner circle represents the months of the year, while the outer calendar represents the days of the week. By using a single pattern/texture the emphasis is placed on the two elements in focus. 

2. The second concepts uses shapes to represent days of the week and colour to highlight the year or hour. Colour would be used in a gradient to have different colours/shades for the chosen variable. 

3. Finally the last example uses the size and value retinal variables. I am calling it the 'darkness calendar' to conceptualize how much light a given month has. Scale is representative of the month, while value is assigned to the season. The darker and larger a shape is one can speculate it would be in the middle of the winter.
