## Process

Listing of the contents of this folder and a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the earthquake data geospatially and diagrammatically.

### Hand Drawn: Diagram Sketches

1. The first diagrammatic concept uses the [2019 significant month](https://github.com/lulujordanna/dvia-2019/blob/master/3.mapping-space/data/2019/significant_month.csv) dataset to create a sequential colour scale based on the magnitude of the earthquakes.  
2. The second idea also examines the magnitude of the earthquakes from the dataset, [all month 2019](https://github.com/lulujordanna/dvia-2019/blob/master/3.mapping-space/data/2019/all_month.csv). This visualization would be a small multiples of bubble charts to represent the month. Colour and scale would signify the magnitude. 
3. The final concept is inspired by a calendar using the [1.0 month](https://github.com/lulujordanna/dvia-2019/blob/master/3.mapping-space/data/1.0_month.csv) data set. This visualization explores the depth of the earthquake by selecting the deepest earthquake per day, colour will represent the range in depth.
