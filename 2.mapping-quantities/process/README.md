## Process

Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources you'll be incorporating into
the project.

### Initial Exploratory Work

The following excel computed graphs are my initial ideas for [A Thousand Suns](https://dvia.samizdat.co/2019/a-thousand-suns/) assignment.

The first graph looks at the total number of tests over time. The x axis will represent the years, the y axis represents the number of tests and the size/colour represents the number of countries involved in the range of years. This presents a big picture overview of nuclear testing over time. 

Based on the learnings from the first graph, the second graph looks at the 1995-2004 range, as it was the time period where the most countries were actively involved in nuclear testing. Currently I represent this in a donut chart but feel this could be a interesting topic to pull external data to understand the socio/political climate and the reasons for the large influx of countries participating. 

The final example is similar to the first by looking at the grand total of nuclear tests by country. It used the same colour palette as graph two which was created based on a qualitative palette in [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3). 

### Hand Drawn Sketches

Building off the exploratory excel graphs, I created three hand drawn sketches of possible ways to represent the data. I also incorporated into these options of additional datasets, particularly with an emphasis on comparing countries nuclear testing to the timeline of the [Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear-Test-Ban_Treaty). 

The first sketch uses shading in the background to represent the CTBTO. The x axis is the years (between 1995 - 2004) and the bubbles would highlight the countries that did testing before, during, and after the treaty was created. I selected the time range of 1995 - 2004 as this was the decade that the most countries did testing. Additional the size and position of the bubble would reflect the amount of tests per country/year.

The second sketch extends the third excel example and would include arches around the bubble to reflect if a country has signed the treaty or not. The final examples adds to this but using shading to highlight the environmental impact of nuclear testing. The darker the black (when more tests occur) the more dangerous this is. While I really like this idea of incorporating the environmental and political data, I am unsure if I will be able to find accurate environmental data
