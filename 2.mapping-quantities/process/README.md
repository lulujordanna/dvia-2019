Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources you'll be incorporating into
the project.

### Initial Exploratory Work

The following excel computed graphs are my initial ideas for [A Thousand Suns](https://dvia.samizdat.co/2019/a-thousand-suns/) assignment.

The first graph looks at the total number of tests over time. The x axis will represent the years, the y axis represents the number of tests and the size/colour represents the number of countries involved in the range of years. This presents a big picture overview of nuclear testing over time. 

Based on the learnings from the first graph, the second graph looks at the 1995-2005 range as it was the time period where the most countries were actively involved in nuclear testing. Currently I represent this in a donut chart but feel this could be a interesting topic to pull external data to understand the socio/political climate and the reasons for the large influx of countries participating. 

The final example is similar to the first by looking at the grand total of nuclear tests by country. It used the same colour palette as graph two which was created based on a qualitative palette in [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3).
